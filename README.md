# Rubiks Cube

This is an old Rubik's Cube implementation I had made back in 2010. I used it to learn Python and OpenGL.

The OpenGL module doesn't seem to work any more, I haven't checked why.

The algorithm is implemented using [Dan Brown's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOgN7d1D-3s) method. It's probably not the best method for a computer.
